Future Improvements


1. MULTI-PACKAGE ASSIGNMENT.
Allow one rider to be assigned multiple packages in a single trip instead of one at a time.

Why:
-Increases delivery efficiency and saves time.
-Reduces repeated trips for nearby destinations.
-Accepts an array of package IDs in the request body.
-Updates all assigned packagesâ€™ statuses and links them to the same rider.


2. BATCH ROUTE DELIVERY. 
Enable riders to follow an optimized delivery route for multiple packages.

Why:
-Makes multi-package delivery more organized.
-Improves route tracking and reduces confusion.
-Integrate with map/route optimization APIs (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap).
-Add route order and checkpoint tracking for each package.
-Each step completed updates progress in real time for admin and customers.


SUMMARY:
These features are planned for future expansion to improve rider efficiency, reduce delivery time, and enhance system intelligence.
